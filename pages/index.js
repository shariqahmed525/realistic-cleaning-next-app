The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) suggests the cleaning of dryer vents and ductwork on a mandatory basis which means they suggest inspecting your HVAC system and air vents to check if there are no pollutants found and they are well maintained. Pollutants may include dirt, allergens, dust, chemicals, pollens, and other things which might be stuck in the air ducts and are polluting your house, making the air contaminated for you and your family. A properly cleaned ducts and dryer vent can work more efficiently and it also lessens the utility bill."
